            <p>Hi, my name is Johans Severino but I go by Sev. I am currently a student at Highschool of Computers and Technology. I am also pursuing a career in code by attending extra curricular programs to gain experience and knowledge of all the languages.
                 But besides the educational life i'll tell you a little bit about myself, I was born in the Dominican Republic but grew up in the Bronx for most of my life I attended all public schools and am a first generation immigrant in the US. I have attended many programs
                 and done many different things that have developed my skills not only as a coder but also as a leader, a businessman and a friend. My goal is to graduate college and be able to begin my own start up and help
                 not only my family but all the other families of color across the world who do not have the opportunities that I once did</p>
